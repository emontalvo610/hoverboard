Changelog
---------

### 0.2.3

* Moved wp-bootstrap-navwalker to a fork at https://github.com/thedotmack/wp-bootstrap-navwalker 
  * There was an issue with the optional wp nav title attribute being used as some sort of hacky hookup for glyphicons, that conflicted with expected nav functionality. Fixed it for our purposes, however removing the glyphicon compatibility that we don't use often enough to keep. Can be fixed at a later date.

### 0.2.2

* Removed default WordPress styling to avoid `!important` hacks

### 0.2.1

* Set Bootstrap to always load the latest version

### 0.2.0

### 0.1.0

* Initial beta release


Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, this theme will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
